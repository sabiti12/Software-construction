# Software process models

## Waterfall model<br>
is a sequential model that divides software development into pre-defined phases. Each phase must be completed before the next phase can begin with no overlap between the phases. Each phase is designed for performing specific activities during the SDLC phase.

The activities include; requirement analysis, system design, implementation, system testing, system deployment and system maintenance.


Waterfall Methodology can be used when:
-	Requirements are not changing frequently
-	Application is not complicated and big
-	Project is short
-	Requirement is clear
-	Environment is stable
-	Technology and tools used are not dynamic and is stable
-	Resources are available and trained

**Advantages**<br> 
-	Any changes in software is made during the process of the development
-	Elaborate documentation is done at every phase of the software’s development cycle
-	Before the next phase of development, each phase must be completed
-	Suited for smaller projects where requirements are well defined

**Disadvantages**<br>
-	It is not desirable for a complex project where requirement changes frequently
-	Errors can be fixed only during the phase
-	Testing period comes quite late in the developmental process
-	Clients valuable feedback cannot be included with ongoing development phase


## Incremental Model
It is a process of software development and focuses on short successive iterations. 

**Advantages**<br>
-	If less number of people are available for project development, then this model is very useful.
-	Technical risks can be managed effectively and in a well-organized manner.
-	The core or final product can be shown to the customer within a small duration of time.


**Disadvantages**<br>
•	Highly and fully committed developers and customers are required for this project.
•	Adopting new technologies and developing the project using this model is very difficult and problematic.
•	Heavy resources can be required.

## Spiral Model
It is developed in iterations and used for risk management. Hence, at new iterations, the requirements can be recognized. 

**Advantages**<br> 
-	By construction of the prototype, the working model of the system can be designed quickly.
-	During the development stage, Project can be refined by the developer and user. Involvement of users in the project.
-	It is very Cost-effective and easy to maintain.
-	Risk analysis and reduction can be done systematically and in a proper manner.
-	Well planned and efficient project development.

**Disadvantages**<br>
-	In series of increments, Software gets developed.
-	If communication with customer is not well or proper then it results in total project failure or non-success or project that might leads to omission of the project.

## Agile Model
The Agile methodology is a way to manage a project by breaking it up into several phases. It involves constant collaboration with stakeholders and continuous improvement at every stage. Once the work begins, teams cycle through a process of planning, executing, and evaluating. Continuous collaboration is vital, both with team members and project stakeholders.

**Advantages of Agile Methodology**<br>
- Customer satisfaction is rapid, continuous development and delivery of useful software.
-	Customer, Developer, and Product Owner interact regularly to emphasize rather than processes and tools.
-	Product is developed fast and frequently delivered (weeks rather than months.)
-	A face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication.
-	It continuously gave attention to technical excellence and good design.
-	Daily and close cooperation between business people and developers.
-	Regular adaptation to changing circumstances.
-	Even late changes in requirements are welcomed.


**Disadvantages of Agile methodology**<br>
-	It is not useful for small development projects.
-	There is a lack of intensity on necessary designing and documentation.
-	It requires an expert project member to take crucial decisions in the meeting.
-	The cost of Agile development methodology is slightly more as compared to other development methodologies.
-	The project can quickly go out off track if the project manager is not clear about requirements and what outcome he/she wants.

# History of software construction

The history of software engineering begins in the 1960s. Writing software has evolved into a profession concerned with how best to maximize the quality of software and of how to create it. Quality can refer to how maintainable software is, to its stability, speed, usability, testability, readability, size, cost, security, and number of flaws or "bugs", as well as to less measurable qualities like elegance, conciseness, and customer satisfaction, among many other attributes. How best to create high-quality software is a separate and controversial problem covering software design principles, so-called "best practices" for writing code, as well as broader management issues such as optimal team size, process, how best to deliver software on time and as quickly as possible, work-place "culture", hiring practices, and so forth.

Software construction is a software engineering discipline. It is the detailed creation of working meaningful software through a combination of coding, verification, unit testing, integration testing, and debugging. It is linked to all the other software engineering disciplines, most strongly to software design and software testing.
